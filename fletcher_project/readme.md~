## RadioScribe: Converting Live Talk Radio Streams Into Searchable Text Data

Before being introduced to the tech startup world in San Francisco, in my first year of college I worked at a morning radio talk show that sustained heavy listenership throughout the greater Bay Area.  Through my experience there I developed a strong affinity for the medium, learning to deeply appeciate the raw intimacy the format provided in ways unlike other forms of traditional mass media could achieve. 

I also learned to question its practicality in the modern age based on some of its flaws, namely the fact that talk radio broadcasting is ephemeral in nature, severely limiting the value of the content as well as its ability to reach and access listeners on a larger scale. Although podcasting in some respects counteracts these contraints, it still doesn't appropriately solve the problems inherent to live talk radio.  First, major terrestrial talk radio stations either do not podcast their content at all, or only do so in limited quantity and regularlity as a promotional mechanism for their live broadcasts.  Second, podcasts by themselves are not effective at providing context about their content. Both podcasts and live radio broadcasts alike force the listener to blindly and passively listen to the content with very little context or control. In the age of DVR, YouTube, Pandora, and Twitter, I felt that the radio can and should be delivered to listeners in a better way by embracing modern machine learning technology - ultimately empowering audiences with more context and on-demand control, while retaining its value as a real-time source of information. Since that delivery system did not exist, I decided to build my own.
