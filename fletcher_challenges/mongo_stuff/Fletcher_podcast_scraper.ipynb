By now, we are really into the groove and this feels like Jawbone\\'s of today. There\\'s a definite newness to this, as if we were trying to impress someone on a first date. I\\'m still experimenting with music at the top of the show and I also swear once or twice at the top of the show, taking full advantage of the podcasting format. I still feel weird about doing that on our show because it is not my personality to use foul language all the time. But I think it was a reaction to me not being able to swear on during our college radio days and I was putting some bravado on for my college radio buddies who were no doubt listening in.<br /><br />Good show.

It sounds pretty bad to my ears. &nbsp;Everything was more or less planned out in my head, but it wasn\\'t really planned out for Nora and you can hear her frustration with me. &nbsp;Nora just wanted to talk and I wanted it to sound like a \"radio\" show. We are definitely still trying to find out footing. &nbsp;But this show was one of those where I felt I had to have content to keep people listening and the \"content\" was me playing carts.<br /><br />Enjoy and let us know if you like this!<br /><br /><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/JawboneRadio\">RSS Feed</a><br /><a href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/jawbone/jb_21605.mp3\" target=\"_blank\">Download Now!</a><br /><a href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/jawbone/jb_21605.mp3\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nobbynees.com%2Fjawbone%2Fimages%2Fpodcast-logo2.gif&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" /></a>',\n",

By now, we are really into the groove and this feels like Jawbone\\'s of today. There\\'s a definite newness to this, as if we were trying to impress someone on a first date. I\\'m still experimenting with music at the top of the show and I also swear once or twice at the top of the show, taking full advantage of the podcasting format. I still feel weird about doing that on our show because it is not my personality to use foul language all the time. But I think it was a reaction to me not being able to swear on during our college radio days and I was putting some bravado on for my college radio buddies who were no doubt listening in.<br /><br />Good show. Very classic experimental Jawbone. We even sound sort of ready for the topic, which is a nice change of pace.<br /><br /> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/JawboneRadio\">RSS Feed</a><br /><a href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/jawbone/jb_21405.mp3\">Download Now!</a><br /><a href=\"http://traffic.libsyn.com/jawbone/jb_21405.mp3\"><img src=\"https://images-blogger-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nobbynees.com%2Fjawbone%2Fimages%2Fpodcast-logo2.gif&amp;container=blogger&amp;gadget=a&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*\" /></a>',\n",
