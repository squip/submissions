Since this is usually very close to the actual center, the algorithm gets there much faster. Try it and compare the results. Example on two-feature data"

Cluster the clients based on their annual spending features (fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, delicatessen). Remember to scale the features before clustering. After finding a reasonable amount of clusters, for EACH cluster, plot the histogram for every single feature: FRESH, MILK, GROCERY, FROZEN, DETERGENTS_PAPER, DELICATESSEN, CHANNEL, REGION. Is there a natural way to characterize each cluster? How would you describe each cluster to the wholesale distributor if you were working for them?"
